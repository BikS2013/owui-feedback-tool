# GitHub Integration Migration Summary

## Overview
Successfully migrated GitHub integration from client-side to server-side, enhancing security by keeping the GitHub token on the backend.

## Changes Made

### Frontend Changes

1. **Created `github-api.service.ts`**
   - New service that proxies all GitHub API calls through the backend
   - Maintains the same interface as the old client-side service
   - Uses async API URL loading from runtime configuration

2. **Updated Components**
   - `SettingsModal.tsx`: Now uses `GitHubApiService` and displays GitHub configuration from backend
   - `PromptSelectorModal.tsx`: Updated to use backend GitHub endpoints and fetch prompts folder config from backend
   - Removed hardcoded references to `VITE_GITHUB_REPO` and `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN`

3. **Removed Files**
   - Deleted `src/services/github.service.ts` (old client-side service)

### Backend Changes

1. **Enhanced GitHub Routes**
   - Updated `/api/github/status` to include `dataFolder` and `promptsFolder` configuration
   - Modified all GitHub endpoints to return consistent response format (wrapped in objects)
   - Added support for both `folder` and `path` query parameters for backwards compatibility

2. **Updated GitHub Service**
   - Modified `checkConnection()` method to return folder configurations from environment variables

## Security Improvements

- GitHub token is now only stored on the backend (via `GITHUB_TOKEN` env variable)
- Frontend no longer has direct access to GitHub API
- All GitHub operations are proxied through authenticated backend endpoints

## Configuration

### Backend Environment Variables
```bash
GITHUB_REPO=owner/repo
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token
GITHUB_DATA_FOLDER=data        # Optional, defaults to 'data'
GITHUB_PROMPTS_FOLDER=prompts  # Optional, defaults to 'prompts'
```

### Frontend Environment Variables (Removed)
- `VITE_GITHUB_REPO` - No longer used
- `VITE_GITHUB_TOKEN` - No longer used
- `VITE_GITHUB_DATA_FOLDER` - No longer used
- `VITE_GITHUB_PROMPTS_FOLDER` - No longer used

## Testing

Both frontend and backend build successfully without TypeScript errors. The GitHub integration now works entirely through the backend API, ensuring the GitHub token is never exposed to the client.
